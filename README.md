Password Strength Evaluation Report

## Objective: Understand what makes a password strong and test it using online strength-checking tools.

## 1. Introduction
The purpose of this task is to explore the characteristics of strong passwords and understand how password complexity impacts security. Using online password strength checkers such as passwordmeter.com, several passwords were tested for strength, and their feedback was analyzed.

## 2. Tools Used

An online tool that analyzes password complexity and provides a score based on various strength metrics.

## Password evaluation
**Password**     **Description**                             **PasswordMeter Score (%)**  **Tool Feedback**                                     
password123`     Common word with numbers                    24%                          Too predictable, easily cracked by dictionary attacks 
Pass1234`        Mixed case and digits                       42%                          Weak, short and lacks special characters              
P@ssw0rd2025!`   Mixed case, digits, symbols, longer length  86%                          Strong, good character mix, still has dictionary word 
X9!eFg#7Lm%`     Completely random, 11 characters            100%                         Very strong, difficult to guess or brute-force       
Summer#Beach22`  Two words + symbols and digits              71%                          Moderate strength, somewhat predictable word pattern  

## 4. Observations & Lessons Learned
Key Factors That Improve Password Strength:
-Length: Longer passwords are significantly harder to crack.
-Character Diversity: Use of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols increases entropy.
--Unpredictability: Random sequences are more secure than recognizable words or phrases.
-Avoid Personal Info: Names, birthdays, and common words make passwords vulnerable.

## 5. Password Creation Tips
-Use at least 12 characters.
-Include all four character types: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
-Avoid dictionary words or common patterns like 123, qwerty, or password.
-Create random or passphrase-style passwords, e.g., Blue$Sky_4Lemon!Tree.
-Consider using a password manager to generate and store strong passwords.

## 6. Common Password Attacks (Research Summary)
**Attack Type**          **Description**                                                                   
**Brute Force Attack** - Tries every possible combination. Slowed down significantly by strong passwords.  
**Dictionary Attack**  - Uses known words or leaked passwords. Easily cracks weak or common passwords.     
**Credential Stuffing**  -Uses login info from previous data breaches. Works well against reused passwords. 


## 7. Importance of Password Complexity
Password complexity significantly increases the time and effort required to crack a password. A simple password can be broken in seconds, while a complex and random password can take millions of years to guess with brute-force methods. Complexity is a critical layer of defense against cyber threats.

## 8. Conclusion
This exercise demonstrated how critical it is to use strong, complex passwords in digital environments. By using evaluation tools and understanding attack methods, we can better protect our online identities and sensitive data. Strong password hygiene, including using unique and complex passwords for each account, is essential for cybersecurity.
